If you are receiving error 
"Couldn't process file Core\Menu\MainWindow.resx due to its being in the Internet or Restricted zone or having the mark of the web on the file. 
Remove the mark of the web if you want to process these file."

To fix:
1. Go to the folder containing the cheat.
2. Look for "Aurora-BlackOps1-main\Aurora-BlackOps1-Zombies\Core\Menu\MainWindow.resx"
3. Right click on it and at the bottom, there will be a checkbox called "Unblock".
4. Click that and hit "Apply".
5. Restart Visual Studio and open the "Aurora-BlackOps1-Zombies.sln".
6. Have fun!
